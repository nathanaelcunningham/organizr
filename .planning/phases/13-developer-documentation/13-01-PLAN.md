**Tech stack available:** Go 1.23, React 19, TypeScript 5.9, Vite 7, Chi router, SQLite, Zustand, TailwindCSS
**Established patterns:** Repository pattern, typed error helpers, test fixtures with functional options
**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 10: Architecture documentation in docs/architecture/, ADR established
- Phase 11: Typed error helpers, OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- Phase 12: Test infrastructure with 60% coverage baseline

**Current state:** Backend README exists with API details, CONTRIBUTING guide exists with setup, but no root README providing project overview for GitHub visitors.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create comprehensive root README</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Create professional README.md at repository root with:

**Structure:**
1. **Header**: Project name, one-line description, badges (if applicable - Go version, license)
2. **Overview**: What Organizr does in 2-3 sentences - audiobook torrent automation from search to organized files
3. **Features**: Bulleted list of key capabilities (MAM search, qBittorrent integration, auto-organization, series detection, batch downloads, configurable templates)
4. **Quick Start**: Minimal setup to run the project - Prerequisites (Go 1.23+, Node 20+, qBittorrent with Web UI), Backend setup (cd backend, make build, make run), Frontend setup (cd frontend, npm install, npm run dev), Basic configuration (qBittorrent URL/credentials via API or UI)
5. **Screenshots/Demo** section placeholder (empty for now - can be added later with actual screenshots)
6. **Core Concepts**: Explain key workflows - Search (MAM integration), Download (qBittorrent automation), Monitor (background progress tracking), Organization (template-based folder creation)
7. **Configuration**: Link to backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md for details, highlight template variables available ({author}, {title}, {series}, {series_number})
8. **API Documentation**: Link to backend/docs/API.md
9. **Development**: Link to CONTRIBUTING.md for setup details, mention test commands (make test, npm test), link to docs/architecture/ADR.md for architecture decisions
10. **Project Structure**: High-level overview - backend/ (Go API), frontend/ (React SPA), docs/ (documentation)
11. **Tech Stack**: Brief mention - Backend: Go + Chi + SQLite, Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand + TailwindCSS, Integration: qBittorrent Web API, MyAnonamouse
12. **License** section (MIT or appropriate license)
13. **Contributing**: Link to CONTRIBUTING.md

**Tone:** Professional but approachable, clear and concise. Focus on what the tool does and how to use it, not implementation details (save those for linked docs).

**What to avoid:** Don't duplicate detailed API docs (link instead), don't include installation of Go/Node (link to official sites), don't explain every configuration option (link to CONFIGURATION.md), don't repeat CONTRIBUTING content.</action>
  <verify>cat README.md shows complete content with all sections, markdown renders correctly (no syntax errors), all internal doc links are valid paths</verify>
  <done>Root README.md exists with project overview, features, quick start, configuration overview, links to detailed docs (API, CONTRIBUTING, ADR), professional formatting suitable for GitHub landing page</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create troubleshooting guide</name>
  <files>docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md</files>
  <action>Create troubleshooting guide covering common issues and solutions:

**Structure:**
1. **qBittorrent Connection Issues**
   - Symptom: "Failed to connect to qBittorrent" errors
   - Solutions: Verify qBittorrent Web UI enabled, check URL format (http://host:port), verify credentials, test with connection test button in UI, check firewall/network access

2. **Download Not Starting**
   - Symptom: Download stuck in "queued" status
   - Solutions: Check qBittorrent logs, verify torrent URL/magnet link valid, ensure qBittorrent has space, check category exists in qBittorrent if using categories

3. **Organization Failures**
   - Symptom: Files download but don't organize
   - Solutions: Check destination path exists and is writable, verify path template is valid (use preview in UI), ensure qBittorrent finished downloading (100% complete), check monitor is running (look for "Monitor started" in logs), verify path mapping if using Docker/remote qBittorrent

4. **Template Variables Not Working**
   - Symptom: Folders created with {author} literal instead of actual author name
   - Solutions: Verify metadata populated (check download details in UI), ensure template syntax correct (no spaces inside braces), check for empty metadata fields

5. **Frontend Won't Connect to Backend**
   - Symptom: Frontend shows connection errors or "Network Error"
   - Solutions: Verify backend running on port 8080, check VITE_API_URL in frontend/.env.development, verify CORS not blocking (backend enables CORS by default), check browser console for specific error

6. **MAM Search Not Working**
   - Symptom: Search returns no results or errors
   - Solutions: Verify MAM API key configured (if required in future), check network connectivity to MyAnonamouse, ensure search query format valid

7. **Tests Failing**
   - Symptom: make test or npm test shows failures
   - Solutions: Run go test -race ./... to check for race conditions, ensure database not in use by running app, check test database has write permissions, run npm test -- --reporter=verbose for detailed frontend test output

**Include for each issue:**
- Clear symptom description
- Step-by-step troubleshooting
- How to verify the fix worked
- Link to relevant documentation (API docs, CONFIGURATION, ADR)

**Avoid:** Implementation details, code-level debugging (save for ADR/CONTRIBUTING)</action>
  <verify>cat docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md shows all sections, covers major user-facing issues, provides clear actionable steps</verify>
  <done>Troubleshooting guide exists covering qBittorrent connection, download issues, organization failures, template problems, frontend/backend connection, search issues, test failures with clear solutions</done>

# Phase 13 Plan 1: Root README and Troubleshooting Summary

**Professional project documentation created - clear entry point for new users and troubleshooting resource**

## Accomplishments

- Created comprehensive root README.md with project overview, features, quick start, and documentation links
- Created troubleshooting guide covering common qBittorrent, download, organization, template, and connection issues
- Established clear documentation hierarchy from overview to detailed guides
- All documentation cross-linked for easy navigation

## Files Created/Modified

- `README.md` - Root project README with complete overview, quick start, feature list, tech stack, and links to detailed docs
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions covering qBittorrent connection, downloads, organization, templates, frontend/backend connectivity

## Decisions Made

None - documentation of existing functionality and patterns

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Step

Phase 13 has more work to do - architecture diagrams and deployment guide would complete developer documentation. Alternatively, move to Phase 14 (Code Quality Tools) for linting and pre-commit hooks.
