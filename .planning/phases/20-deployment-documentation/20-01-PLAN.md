<objective>
Enhance README with deployment quick start guide that directs users to comprehensive deployment documentation.

Purpose: Make deployment options discoverable from README without duplicating the detailed docs/DEPLOYMENT.md content. Users should quickly understand deployment options and know where to find full instructions.
Output: Updated README.md with deployment section linking to existing comprehensive guides.

**Tech stack available:** Docker, Docker Compose, nginx, systemd, godotenv, multi-stage builds
**Established patterns:** Production-ready Dockerfiles, multi-container orchestration, environment variable precedence, volume mount strategy

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 16: Alpine base images with non-root user, multi-stage builds
- Phase 17: Service orchestration with health checks, volume management
- Phase 18: ENV > Database > Defaults precedence pattern
- Phase 19: Named volumes for dev, host path mounts for production (Unraid focus)

**Context from Phase 19:**
Phase 19 created comprehensive deployment documentation (docs/DEPLOYMENT.md, 928 lines) covering:
- Docker deployment with docker-compose.yml
- Unraid-specific setup with volume mapping examples
- Troubleshooting sections for common deployment issues
- systemd service configuration for bare metal deployments

This phase should NOT duplicate that content. Instead, enhance README to help users discover deployment options and navigate to the detailed guide.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add deployment section to README</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Add a "## Deployment" section to README.md between "## Quick Start" and "## Screenshots" sections.

Content structure:
1. Brief intro: "Organizr can be deployed with Docker (recommended for production) or as standalone binaries"
2. Docker deployment quick start:
   - 2-3 command quick start for Docker Compose
   - Note about .env configuration requirement
   - Link to comprehensive deployment guide
3. Unraid deployment note:
   - One sentence about Unraid support with docker-compose.yml
   - Link to Unraid section in deployment guide
4. Bare metal deployment note:
   - One sentence about systemd service deployment option
   - Link to systemd section in deployment guide
5. Link to troubleshooting guide

Keep this section SHORT - 15-20 lines total. It's a signpost to detailed docs, not the full instructions. Use markdown links to docs/DEPLOYMENT.md with anchor links to specific sections where appropriate.

**What to avoid:**
- Don't duplicate the detailed deployment steps from docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
- Don't include full docker-compose.yml or systemd service files (that's in docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Don't create a wall of text - keep it scannable with clear links

**Why:** README should give users enough information to understand deployment options and find detailed instructions, but not overwhelm them. Detailed steps belong in dedicated deployment docs.
  </action>
  <verify>
README.md contains new "## Deployment" section with links to docs/DEPLOYMENT.md and docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md. Section is between "Quick Start" and "Screenshots". grep -A 20 "## Deployment" README.md shows the new content.
  </verify>
  <done>
Deployment section exists in README with Docker quick start, Unraid note, bare metal note, and links to detailed documentation. Section is concise (15-20 lines) and serves as navigation to comprehensive guides.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update troubleshooting section reference</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update the existing "## Troubleshooting" section in README (currently near the end) to be more prominent and comprehensive.

Current section says:
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues and solutions.

Quick checks:
- **qBittorrent connection fails**: Verify Web UI enabled, check URL format, test credentials
- **Downloads not organizing**: Check destination path exists, verify template syntax, ensure qBittorrent finished download
- **Frontend can't reach backend**: Verify backend running on port 8080, check CORS settings
```

Enhance this by:
1. Add Docker-specific troubleshooting items after the existing quick checks:
   - **Container won't start**: Check docker-compose logs, verify .env file exists
   - **Backend can't reach qBittorrent**: Ensure qBittorrent URL uses host networking or container name
   - **Permission errors with volumes**: Verify host path ownership (uid/gid 1001)
2. Keep the link to comprehensive troubleshooting guide at the top
3. Keep it concise - just add 3 Docker-specific one-liners to the bullet list

**What to avoid:**
- Don't remove existing troubleshooting items
- Don't add detailed debugging steps (that's in docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Don't exceed 5-6 total quick check items (keep it scannable)

**Why:** README should provide instant help for the most common issues users will hit (especially Docker issues for production users) while directing them to comprehensive troubleshooting for deep dives.
  </action>
  <verify>
README.md Troubleshooting section includes Docker-specific items. grep -A 15 "## Troubleshooting" README.md shows enhanced content with Docker issues added.
  </verify>
  <done>
Troubleshooting section in README includes Docker-specific quick checks (container won't start, network issues, permission errors) alongside existing items. Total quick checks list remains concise (6 items max).
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add production deployment note to Quick Start</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Add a brief callout box at the end of the "## Quick Start" section (after "Basic Configuration" subsection) that points production users to deployment docs.

Add this callout:
```markdown
> **💡 Production Deployment:** The Quick Start above is for local development. For production deployment with Docker, see [Deployment](#deployment) below or jump directly to [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
```

Place this right before the "## Screenshots" section (or "## Deployment" section if Task 1 already added it).

**What to avoid:**
- Don't add deployment instructions to Quick Start section (that's for local dev)
- Don't make this callout verbose - single line with link is enough
- Don't duplicate the deployment section content here

**Why:** Users scanning Quick Start might assume those are production deployment instructions. This callout clarifies that Quick Start = local dev, and explicitly directs production users to the right section. Prevents confusion and support requests from users trying to deploy the dev setup to production.
  </action>
  <verify>
README.md contains production deployment callout at end of Quick Start section. grep -B 3 "## Screenshots\|## Deployment" README.md shows the callout preceding the next section.
  </verify>
  <done>
Production deployment callout exists in README after Quick Start section, directing users to deployment documentation. Callout is concise (single line) and prevents confusion between dev setup and production deployment.
  </done>
</task>

# Phase 20 Plan 01: Deployment Documentation Summary

**[Substantive one-liner - what changed]**

## Accomplishments

- Added Deployment section to README with Docker/Unraid/bare metal quick start
- Enhanced Troubleshooting section with Docker-specific items
- Added production deployment callout to Quick Start section
- Established clear documentation hierarchy (README → docs/)

## Files Created/Modified

- `README.md` - Added deployment section, enhanced troubleshooting, added production callout

## Decisions Made

**Documentation hierarchy:** README serves as navigation hub with quick starts and links to comprehensive guides in docs/. This prevents README bloat while ensuring users can discover deployment options easily.

**Deployment section placement:** Positioned between Quick Start (local dev) and Screenshots to maximize visibility for production users without interrupting the getting-started flow.

## Issues Encountered
