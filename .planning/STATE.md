# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-06)

**Core value:** Perfect folder structures and file placement every time - audiobooks land exactly where Audiobookshelf expects them, automatically.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 — End-to-End Testing

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 6 (Frontend Integration)
Plan: 1 of 1 complete
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-07 — Completed plan 05-01 (frontend integration verification and UX enhancements)

Progress: █████████░ 83% (Phases 1, 1.1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 complete, 7 plans done)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: ~90 minutes
- Total execution time: 10.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2 | 1.0h | 30m |
| 1.1 | 1 | 0.1h | 6m |
| 2 | 1 | 6.0h | 357m |
| 3 | 1 | 0.4h | 22m |
| 4 | 1 | 0.8h | 45m |
| 5 | 1 | 1.5h | 90m |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01 (357m), 03-01 (22m), 04-01 (45m), 05-01 (90m)
- Trend: Test setup and UX enhancement phases moderate (Phase 5), implementation phases longer (Phase 2)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **MAM authenticated downloads**: MAM URLs trigger torrent file download before qBittorrent upload (required for private tracker authentication)
- **Category support**: Categories are optional parameters passed through to qBittorrent for torrent organization
- **Hash retrieval**: Query qBittorrent API after upload sorted by added_on timestamp (reliable for all torrent sources)
- **Retry strategy**: Max 3 attempts with 500ms delay for torrent info query to handle qBittorrent processing delay
- **Error handling philosophy**: User-friendly messages without exposing internals
- **Context timeout for organization**: 5-minute timeout allows large file operations to complete while preventing indefinite hanging during shutdown
- **Monitor resilience**: Continue monitoring when all downloads fail (qBittorrent may be unavailable), log warnings but don't stop
- **Path mapping for remote deployments**: Single mount point config prepended to qBittorrent paths (supports Docker and network shares)
- **Template validation approach**: Sanitize individual variables before template parsing to preserve directory structure while cleaning filenames
- **Preview debounce timing**: 500ms debounce for preview API calls balances responsiveness with server load
- **Copy operation strategy**: All-or-nothing pattern with automatic cleanup on failure (delete partial copies)
- **Move operation strategy**: Partial success acceptable (atomic per file, already moved files stay moved)
- **Disk space checking**: 10% buffer added to required space for filesystem overhead
- **Interface-based testing**: Refactored OrganizationService to use interfaces for dependency injection and mockability

### Roadmap Evolution

- **Phase 1.1 inserted after Phase 1** (2026-01-06): qBittorrent Connection Testing (URGENT)
  - Reason: ISS-001 discovered during Phase 1 testing - users need diagnostic tool for qBittorrent connectivity
  - Impact: Addresses testing gaps before building Phase 2 monitoring (which depends on reliable qBittorrent connection)

### Deferred Issues

None - ISS-001 resolved in Phase 1.1

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
